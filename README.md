## Built with Matterwiki

Added ability to upload and link to files in wiki posts.

Changed from a single admin user to an admin user group.
Those not a part of the admin user group can do nothing beyond login, see posts, and logout.

Created docker volume to store uploaded documents.

Works with docker out of the box.
